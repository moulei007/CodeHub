# Update
- This time I have updated some codes about how to get indivadual region of every segment.
- see:
  * `slic_segment.py`

- This code I created using skimage packages with python
- You should run this script using `python slic.py` command. If you want to test your own iamge(s), please modify the source code in `slic.py`
